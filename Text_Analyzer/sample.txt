Once upon a time  
in a land far, far away,  

There lived a coder. And he had an idea!  
He wanted to make a "cat-walking-on-keyboard-proof" program —  
a tool to analyze text and count letters, digits, words, and sentences.

If, in the middle of typing, his cat jumped on the keyboard and typed  
symbols like $$$ or &^*( — they would be ignored as words and not counted!!!

And if he cuddled the cat and forgot to press space after punctuation,  
it would still count as a new sentence.

He tested it with 3 cats, 2 hamsters, and 1 ambitious spider,
counted: "5, 4, 3, 2, 1" and pressed run:)
